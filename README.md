# Space Travler's Hub

In this project, we have worked with the real live data from the `SpaceX API`. Our task is to build a web application for a company that provides commercial and scientific space travel services. The application will allow users to book rockets and join selected space missions.

- The Space Travelers' Hub consists of `Rockets`, `Missions`, and the `My Profile` section.

## Built with

- HTML/CSS
- React-Redux
- Node.JS
- SpaceX API

### Project Requirements

#### Config & basic setup

- Create React App.
- Install React Redux, Redux Logger and React Router.
- Create routes and view components.Use `<NavLink />` for the page navigation links
- Create directories for all Redux state slice files.

#### Other Requirements

- Fetch data from the SpaceX API endpoints.
- Once the data are fetched, dispatch an action to store the selected data in Redux store
  - Rockets:
    - id, rocket_name, description, flickr_images
  - Missions:
    - mission_id, mission_name, description
- Use `useSelector()` Redux Hook to select the state slices and render lists of rockets and missions in corresponding routes
- Write actions and reducers for `booking rockets` and `joining missions`
- Write actions and reducers for `canceling rockets` and `leaving missions`
- Rockets that have already been reserved display a `Reserved` badge and `Cancel reservation` button
- Missions that the user has joined already display a badge `Active Member` instead of the default "NOT A MEMBER" and a button `Leave Mission`
- `My Profile` section compose of two column layout and list ONLY the `rockets reserved` and `missions joined` by the user
